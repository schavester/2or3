This is the kitchen from the house on Rountree in Rancho Park.  I remember at some point soon after this photo the brick wall was taken down, with great consternation.  The table was replaced by a wooden one which sat six, and had wings for expanding to 10 &amp; 12.  The table was purchased in British Columbia at an antique shop.  The table in the photo came from my grandfather&#8217;s store, I believe.  My mother does not look happy.  She has never liked to cook.  I think even at this age it was obvious to me that I was going to have to take over making dinner ASAP.</p>

It does not seem possible that this photo was taken when I was in 9th grade, but that is my first memory of using a frame pack.  No family holidays required such preparations.  The trip took us out into the woods for four days of what I remember as fun and excitement, but I also recall my friends on the trip did not agree.  As I remember our group was small, hence the guides decided to take us off the beaten path&#8211;they were used to a larger group.  Richard Rushfield did not enjoy the trip as I remember, and the guides made fun of us for being so clean cut their our necks got sunburn.  My hair looks pretty long, so again, I question my memory.</p>

Living in the trailer in the corner of an apple orchard in NW Albuquerque.  Just off the zanja.  Horace rented it to us for $30/month.  I believe we were there 2 months.  He built his house himself out of adobe brick he made.  Worked in the stock yards in the 1960s.   Used to get up @ 3am, work on building the house for 90 minutes, then go to work.  I liked Horace.  He was a good guy.  It was a quiet lane.  I built an archway and a chimney while we were there for a contractor (his own house) just down the street.</p>

This photo was taken at my birthday party in 1988.  I am standing in front of Nathan Marsak&#8217;s hearse.  There are other photos from this event which will eventually surface.  </p>
<p>This photo is of note because it is the quickest way to explain why my wife refused to even say hello to me even though we were in the same department and shared the same advisor&#8211;who confided in me that we were soul mates.  I laughed when Jasper told me that.  Character is fate, as I remember reading somewhere. . .</p>
